# This Is My Second Day Of Mastering JavaScript In 20 Days

## Expressions
An equation that will be evaluated to a value (True or False)


## Variables
We should use camelCase to declare variables

- **Decalring a variable:** like (let myVar) here the initial value of myVar is undefined.
- **Assigning a variable:** like (myVar = "Mohammad").
- **We can do it both in the same line of code:** like (let var = 123).

**Note** we can declare a variable using const keyword but we will be able to assign it a value just one time.
