# This Is My fourth Day Of Mastering JavaScript In 20 Days

## Lessons Summary
- Web browser fires many events when something hppend, so we need to handle this events , so the JS offers many methods to handle this events.
- Conditional statement like "if" statement let us run the code under certain conditions.
- JS can only do one task at a time ("single-threaded").
- Some actions needed a lot of time to run like "waiting from user events " ,so we use an asynchronus code for it .
- "setTimeout" method is used to delay action.

# Coding Examples 

```
// loops Examples
const numbers = [1,2,3];

for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    console.log(numbers[i]);
}

for (let n of numbers) {
    console.log(n);
}
-----------------------------------------------------
// map and filter Examples
//From the spices array, use map and filter to create a new array endInY with just the girls whose nickname ends in "y"
const spices = [
    {name: "Emma", nickname: "Baby"},
    {name: "Geri", nickname: "Ginger"},
    {name: "Mel B", nickname: "Scary"},
    {name: "Mel C", nickname: "Sporty"},
    {name: "Victoria", nickname: "Posh"}
];
let endInY=spices.filter(s=>s.nickname.endsWith("y"));
```



## coding Exercises
Use Multiple Conditional (Ternary) Operators
```
function checkSign(num) {
return (num==0) ?"zero": num>0?"positive":"negative"; 
}

checkSign(10); // 
```
Golf Code
```
const names = ["Hole-in-one!", "Eagle", "Birdie", "Par", "Bogey", "Double Bogey", "Go Home!"];

function golfScore(par, strokes) {
  // Only change code below this line


  return strokes === 1
    ? names[0]
    : strokes <= par - 2
    ? names[1]
    : strokes === par - 1
    ? names[2]
    : strokes === par
    ? names[3]
    : strokes === par + 1
    ? names[4]
    : strokes === par + 2
    ? names[5]
    : names[6];;
  // Only change code above this line
}

golfScore(5, 4);
```
